class FindingBestTitleForCV:
    """
    This class is designed to find the best matching job titles for candidates based on the skills extracted from their CVs.

    The class matches the skills listed in the CVs against predefined job categories and their associated skills.
    It then calculates similarity scores to determine which job titles are the best match for each candidate.

    Attributes:
        data_skills (dict): A dictionary to store skills extracted from CVs.
        job_categories (dict): A dictionary to store job categories and their associated skills.
        matched_jobs (dict): A dictionary to store the best matching job titles for each CV.
        candidates_skills (str): Path to the CSV file where the extracted skills from CVs are stored.

    Methods:
        load_job_categories: Loads job categories and their skills from a JSON file.
        preprocess_skills: Processes skills for similarity comparison.
        calculate_similarity_scores: Calculates similarity scores between CV
        skills and job category skills.
        match_skills_with_titles: Matches CV skills with job titles and
        stores the best matches.
        print_matched_jobs: Prints the matched job titles for each CV.
